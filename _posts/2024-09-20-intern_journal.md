### Brief summery of the WEEK
---

This week, I made significant progress with my institute website, thanks to the help of my colleague chimi. Although the project has taken time, my supervisor has been incredibly supportive and encouraging throughout. Designing a user interface is not as easy as it seems; it requires careful attention to UI and UX principles. We need to examine every aspect of the design to ensure it’s visually appealing, not just another cluttered layout. While a design may look good to us, it’s crucial to consider it from the user’s perspective. A well-designed interface attracts users, and no matter how great the content is, if the design isn't user-friendly, it won’t serve its purpose.

during this figma design i have looked through many web design for my institute website as a source of inspiration.that are Dhi,GCIT,material design, pitrest templates, envato,tashi cell mobile app.

### What did I learn / do this week?
This week, with the help of my colleague Chimi, we made our website fully responsive, adapting the design for tablets and desktops. We adjusted the shapes and sizes of several components, added additional elements that weren't included on the phone version, and opted for minimal animations to keep the design clean.
