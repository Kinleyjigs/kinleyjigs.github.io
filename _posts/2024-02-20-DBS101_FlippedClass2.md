### Entity relational model

#### Summary on what I did on flipped class
---
In my last flipped class, like last time, we teamed up with our group members. This time, we were tasked with drawing an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) model. Before creating the ER model, we needed to understand what an ER model is. An ERD is simply a diagram used to describe the structure of a database. We had to familiarize ourselves with key terms in the ERD model, such as attributes, entities, relationships, primary keys, and cardinalities. The Group no.1 did on the Online health book (E-health), Group no.2 was about the Airline ticketing, Group no.3 was on the Mobile Banking Application, Group no.4 was on the Student information management system that was Student data detailing programs enrolled in, modules, and bio data. Group no.5 was on the Bus booking lastly Group no.6 me and my groups did on the Voter registration.

#### Things learned in Flipped class 
---
In the flipped class, I delved into the intricacies of the ERD model, exploring its attributes, entities, relationships, and cardinalities in depth. Moreover, I thoroughly absorbed the practical application of ERD symbols and notation, thanks to the insightful discussions with my group mates. Their perspectives and collaborative efforts greatly enriched my learning experience, providing invaluable insights that significantly expanded my knowledge of the ERD model. Without their contributions, my understanding of ERD would have been considerably limited.
 
#### Feedback on Flipped Class 
---
I found this flipped class to be more interesting and a better way to learn. We can learn more through interaction with our classmates, clarifying doubts, teaching others, and most importantly, presenting to the class, which helps improve our confidence and understanding. In contrast to traditional lecture classes where some students may appear disengaged and leave without learning much, I believe the flipped class is a great strategy for learning.
