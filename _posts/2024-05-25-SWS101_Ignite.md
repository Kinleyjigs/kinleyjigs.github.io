**HELLO guys!**
This is a ctf journal on Ignite and i will be guiding you guys how to do this machine step by steps.

### Exploring the website
Exploring the website I have got this a Fuel CMS page with version 1.4.  I search for exploit code that I could use to gain access to the machine.

I used the **searchsploit** module to find the exploit code for Fuel CMS 1.4. It searches the Exploit Database â€” a comprehensive database of exploits, shellcode, and security vulnerabilities.

Then I downloaded the first python script by running the following command:

    searchsploit -m php/webapps/50477.py

Changing the Ip address in the python script I ran the python file where it opens a command prompt.

Then I will do a reverse shell by running a code that I copied from a cheetsheet that is pentest monkey.

From terminal I did netcat on port 4444 and it was successful now I can access the machine from my terminal.
