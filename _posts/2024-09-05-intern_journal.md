### worked on the figma design 

Today was a bit slower in terms of progress, as I focused on mastering Figma while working on the website prototype for the institute.

My supervisor shared several documents related to the iBEST institute website, which I've been carefully reviewing to extract key information. I've been taking detailed notes and identifying essential elements to integrate into the prototype to ensure it aligns with the project's goals and vision.
