### Brief summery of the WEEK

---
By the end of this week, I successfully completed most of the entire UI design for smaller screen. For this prototype, I focused on the iPhone 14 and 15 Pro Max models. I’ve also uploaded a brief walkthrough video of the prototype below.

The design process took longer than expected, as it wasn’t an easy task, and I had to make several adjustments based on feedback from my supervisor. He introduced me to some excellent websites with pleasing designs to serve as sources of inspiration. Two that stood out were Material Design and Apple’s design guidelines, which I used to refine my work after incorporating his suggestions.
