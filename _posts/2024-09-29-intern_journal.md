### Brief summery of the WEEK
---
This week, after our supervisor reviewed our website and provided feedback, he suggested adding some animations. He specifically asked us to test the animations on the phone version to see if they suit the design. As a result, we spent the week implementing animations across the entire page, and I feel that the website now looks more visually appealing and polished.

### What did i learn this week?
This week, I learned how to create animations in Figma. I referred to several YouTube videos, templates, and other websites for guidance, and I'm confident that our design is now much more visually appealing. Although learning how to animate in Figma wasnâ€™t particularly difficult, it took some time to fully grasp and implement the animations on the website.
