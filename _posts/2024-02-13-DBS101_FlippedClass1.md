### Database Users and Administators
----
In my last flipped class that was on feb 13  I learned about the types of database users and the DBA (database administator)  

First of all a database is a collection of a organized data stored in a computer system

As of now I have learned 8 different types of database users in DBMS that are :

1. Database administator
2. Naive / Parametic end users
3. System analyst
4. Sophisticated Users
5. Database Designers
6. Application programmer 
7. Temporary user 
8. Specialized users 

1.Database Administator:
DBA is an IT professional that looks upon the whole database system, they ensure the security of the entire database form an unauthorized access.

2.Naive/Parametic users:
Naive user are those users that doesn't have any knowledge on the workings of the DBMS but uses it to fulfil their own desires.
Eg. Clerks at any bank are naive users because they have no DBMS understanding, yet they still use the database to do their assigned tasks.

3.System Analyst:
Systen Analyst are users who checks whether the requirments of naive users. They ensure the requirments of naive user are fulfilled and satisfied,

4.Sophisticated Users:
Users that can create their own database as per their own requirments are called sophicasted users.They don't write the program code, but instead interact with the database by writing SQL queries directly through the query processor.
Eg. engineers,scientist,etc..

5.Database Designers:
Database designer are those who decides the arrangement of all piece of infomation in the database.Their main goal is to create a design that work well for all the one using the database.

6.Application programmer / system analysts / software engineer:
They are back-end programmer that writes code, design, debug, test, and maintain set of programs called “canned transactions” for the Naive (parametric) users in order to interact with database. They uses Programming languages such as Visual Basic, Developer, C, FORTRAN, COBOL etc

7.Casual Users / Temporary Users:
The users that use the database for an often but needs everything up-to-date is called casual users. For instance, a manager who routinely checks the database to ensure they have the latest updates.

8.Specialized users: 
Specialized users are professionals who create customized computer programs for jobs that do not follow standard data processing procedures. These jobs might include constructing elaborate structures using a computer, collecting large amounts of information for specialists to utilize, or developing systems that function as qualified experts in specialized fields.

### Roles of Database Administators
----
Some of the main roles of DBAs (Database Administators) that were learn on the flipped class are:-
- Database Design: Database design include effectively organizing data, finding connections between data components, and optimizing performance. It aims to provide data integrity, scalability, and efficient retrieval and storage. Effective design generates a well-structured database schema that meets the requirements of the intended application.

- Database Security: DBA provide database security through access control, encryption, and auditing, protecting data integrity and confidentiality while actively cooperating with IT security teams to reduce risks and maintain compliance.
