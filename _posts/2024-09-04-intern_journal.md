Upon my arrival at iBEST Institute, I was warmly welcomed by the Operations Director, Mr. Tenzin. He guided me through the company's rules and regulations, and we signed the three-month internship contract. With a smile, he wished me luck on this exciting journey ahead.

He then introduced me to one of the software developers, Mr. Tshering Wangdi. Under his guidance, I met the rest of the software development team. The entire room buzzed with activity, filled with the energy of dedicated professionals working on iBEST's renowned project in Bhutanâ€”Educare Skill.

Educare Skill is an innovative online education and skilling platform designed to offer the most relevant courses to help young Bhutanese excel academically and advance their careers.

Later, Mr. Tshering introduced me to the Chief Supervisor of the Software Department, Mr. Sonam Tobgay. With a welcoming demeanor, he outlined my responsibilities for the internship. My first task was to develop a new webpage for the iBEST Institute and Consultancy. To kickstart this project, he assigned me to create a website prototype using Figma, encouraging me to bring creativity and fresh ideas to the table.
