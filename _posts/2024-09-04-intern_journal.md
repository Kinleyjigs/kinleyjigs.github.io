Upon my arrival at iBEST Institute, I was warmly welcomed by the Operations Director, Mr. Tenzin. He guided me through the company's rules and regulations, and we signed the three-month internship contract. With a smile, he wished me luck on this exciting journey ahead.

He then introduced me to one of the software developers, Mr. Tshering Wangdi. Under his guidance, I met the rest of the software development team. The entire room buzzed with activity, filled with the energy of dedicated professionals working on iBEST's renowned project in Bhutanâ€”Educare Skill.

Educare Skill is an innovative online education and skilling platform designed to offer the most relevant courses to help young Bhutanese excel academically and advance their careers.

Later, Mr. Tshering introduced me to the Chief Supervisor of the Software Department, Mr. Sonam Tobgay. With a welcoming demeanor, he outlined my responsibilities for the internship. My first task was to develop a new webpage for the iBEST Institute and Consultancy. To kickstart this project, he assigned me to create a website prototype using Figma, encouraging me to bring creativity and fresh ideas to the table.

#### Intern Day 2
### worked on the figma design 

Today was a bit slower in terms of progress, as I focused on mastering Figma while working on the website prototype for the institute.

My supervisor shared several documents related to the iBEST institute website, which I've been carefully reviewing to extract key information. I've been taking detailed notes and identifying essential elements to integrate into the prototype to ensure it aligns with the project's goals and vision.

A senior software developer, Tshering, introduced me to website design and the importance of matching color schemes. He recommended using resources like **Color Hunt**, **Pinterest**, and **Dribbble** for inspiration.

This is my Day 3 progress. I'm currently focusing on making the prototype responsive on iPhone 14 and 15 screen sizes (393x852). By starting with a smaller screen, I can prioritize and refine the key components before adjusting for larger desktop screens.
